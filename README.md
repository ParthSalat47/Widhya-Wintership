# Widhya-Wintership
This repo contains my projects done during the Widhya intership that began in Jan 2021

# Project 1 - Build a Customer Review Web App
In this project I was introduced to:
> Flask, and wtforms. <br/>
> CSS, and Jingja. <br/>

I've also used Pandas to build the project

# Project 2 - Uber Shortest Path Computation
In this project I understood the concepts of:
> Directed, Undirected, & Wieghted graphs. <br/>
> How we can measure the shortest distance between different points using different algorithms. <br/>

This gave me a general overview about how Uber API works to get the shortest distance between a rider and a driver, & source point and destination point. I was also introduced to:
> Manhattan, BellmanFord, & Dijstkra algorithms. <br/>
> The concept of time complexity of algorithms. <br/>

Unfortunately, most of us (candicates) couldn't witness the action these algorithms through testing the Uber API as Uber has recently changed lots of its policies which limited lots of features we needed to gain access to the API. So, I tried to get another benefit which is translating what I've written in Python to C++, and that was in order to upskill my problem solving skills abit, and that option was available during the mission as we were allowed to program in either Python or C++.

# Project 3 - API Development Using Flask
Here I was introduced to more advanced Flask capabilites, such as:
> Configuring access methods to a resource (GET, POST, PUT, & DELETE). <br/>
> Configuring basic security HTTP authentication using flask-httpauth module. <br/>
> Error handling of some messages. <br/>
