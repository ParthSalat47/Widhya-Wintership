# Widhya-Wintership
This repo contains my projects made during the Widhya intership that began in Jan 2021

# Project 1 - Build a Customer Review Web App
In this project I was introduced to:
> Flask, and wtforms <br/>
> CSS, and Jingja <br/>

I also used Pandas to build the project

# Project 2 - Uber Shortest Path Computation
In this project I understood the concepts of directed, undirected, & wieghted graphs, and how to measure the shortest distance between different points using different algorithms, which gave us a general overview about how Uber API works to get the shortest distance between a rider and driver, & source point and destination point. I was introduced to Manhattan, BellmanFord, & Dijstkra algorithms. <br/> <br/>

Unfortunately, most of us (candicates) couldn't witness the action these algorithms through testing Uber API because Uber changed lots of its policies which limited lots of features we needed to gain access to the API. So, I tried to get another benefit which is translating what I've written in Python into C++ (to upskill my problem solving skills abit and that option was available during the mission as we were allowed to program in either Python or C++)
